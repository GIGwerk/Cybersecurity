- Mo Radwan: [Cybersecurity Cyber Usalama](https://www.slideshare.net/MuhammadRadwan10/cybersecurity-cyber-usalama) (on Slideshare.net) | December 2018 | language: English <br> </br>
This training was conducted with GIG partners, [Swahilibox](https://swahilibox.co.ke/) in Mombasa Kenya. The format was replicated from a Facebook training given to programmers in Berlin Germany in Novemeber 2018.  The format was adapted and tailored for the Kenyan context.  It was also adapted to include more privacy tools and applications.  The intent was for the training to be replicated, thus all tools were made to be open source in the spirit of collaboration and critical skills knowledge sharing.
